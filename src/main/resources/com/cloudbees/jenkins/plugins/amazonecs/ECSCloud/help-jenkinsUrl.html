    Alternative URL for the JNLP agent to utilize in order to contact this Jenkins server.

    <P>
    For instance, if there is a URL on the public internet and a URL on a private intranet which
    lead to your Jenkins server this parameter can tell the plugin to use the private URL instead.

    <p>
    Leave this field empty to use the default Jenkins' URL
